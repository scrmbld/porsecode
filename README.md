A simple program for encoding and decoding morse code written in Python. Each character represents a unit of time. A single character represents a dot, and three consecutive characters represent a dash. One space is the separation between two dots/dashes that are part of the dame letter, and three spaces represents a separation between words.

## Usage

To encode to morse, simply run `encode.py`. To decode from morse, run `decode.py`.
